# Java Chat Bot Project

The goal of this project is to give people an easy-to-use, engaging chatbot experience.The chatbot can answer questions based on the data stored in a MySQL database. I have used JDBC to establish a connection with the database and retrieve questions and answers.

# Features
1 - Interactive Chat Interface: Users can ask questions and receive answers from the chatbot.
2 - MySQL Database: Questions and answers are stored in a MySQL database for efficient data management.
3 - User-Friendly UI: The project includes an entry frame with a button that leads users to the main chat interface.
4 - Easy to Use: The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and can handle a variety of queries.

# Prerequisites
1 - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2 - MySQL database server installed and running.
3 - MySQL Connector/J library for JDBC connection.
4 - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
